# 🪟 Day 62 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 62 Task**, where I created a **Windows-like Desktop UI** using **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**.

The interface mimics core Windows behavior such as a **taskbar with app icons**, **open/close app windows**, and a **custom right-click desktop context menu** with options like Refresh and New.

This task helped me understand **UI state management**, **event handling**, **context menus**, and building realistic desktop-like interactions using vanilla web technologies.

## 📌 About the Day 62 Task

Day 62 focused on building a **desktop-style interface** inspired by Windows OS.  
I learned how to:

- Toggle applications from a taskbar
- Manage active window state
- Create a custom right-click context menu
- Prevent default browser context menu
- Position UI elements dynamically using mouse coordinates
- Separate structure, style, and behavior cleanly

## ✨ Task Features

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| 🪟 Windows-like Taskbar | Taskbar with app icons similar to Windows |
| 🔁 App Toggle System | Click icon to open / close apps |
| 🖱️ Custom Right-Click Menu | Desktop context menu appears on right click |
| 🚫 Taskbar Menu Blocking | Context menu disabled on taskbar area |
| 📍 Dynamic Positioning | Menu appears near mouse pointer |
| 🎨 Smooth UI Styling | Rounded corners and modern UI feel |
| 🧼 Clean Code Structure | Organized HTML, SCSS nesting, and JS logic |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of desktop, taskbar, and windows  
- **SCSS** – Styling, nesting, and UI design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – App toggle logic and right-click behavior  
- **Remix Icons** – App icons  
- **VS Code** – Development environment  

## 📖 Learning Outcome

By completing this task, I learned:

- How to simulate desktop UI behavior using JavaScript
- How to toggle UI components based on state
- How to build a custom context menu
- How to handle mouse events like click and right-click
- How to prevent default browser actions
- How SCSS nesting improves code readability
- How to build realistic UI interactions without libraries

This task strengthened my understanding of **event-driven UI**, **state management**, and **desktop-style interactions in web applications**.

## 🌟 Acknowledgement

This **Day 62 Task** helped me explore how desktop operating systems can be simulated on the web using pure frontend technologies.

Thanks to **Cohort 2.0** for providing creative and challenging tasks that push practical learning and UI thinking.
