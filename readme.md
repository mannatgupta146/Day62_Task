Day 62 Task | Cohort 2.0
This project is my Day 52 Task, where I created a fully interactive Torch Light Effect UI using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
The screen displays a fullscreen background video, and a dynamic flashlight/torch effect follows the mouse pointer using a radial-gradient overlay.

This task helped me understand CSS gradients, custom properties (--x, --y), layering video backgrounds, and creating real-time interactive visual effects with JavaScript and SCSS.

📌 About the Day 52 Task
Day 52 focused on building a realistic torch/spotlight effect on top of a video background. I learned how to:

Use radial-gradient() to create a flashlight-like effect
Update CSS variables dynamically using JavaScript
Track mouse movement to reposition gradients
Layer <video> elements behind content using z-index
Use SCSS nesting for clean and readable code
Create soft, cinematic lighting effects on moving backgrounds
✨ Task Features
Feature	Description
🔦 Dynamic Torch Effect	A smooth spotlight follows the mouse cursor.
🎥 Background Video	Fullscreen autoplay video with perfect object-fit cover.
🎨 Custom Gradient Lighting	Multi-layer radial gradient for a realistic flashlight feel.
🖱️ Mouse Tracking	CSS variables update in real time with cursor movement.
📐 SCSS Nesting	Clean and structured styling using nested rules.
⚡ Smooth Performance	Lightweight effect using pure CSS + JS.
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Structure
SCSS – Styling and gradient effects
JavaScript (ES6) – Mouse tracking + dynamic variables
MP4 Video – Background animation
VS Code – Development environment
📖 Learning Outcome
By completing this task, I learned:

How CSS radial gradients work in layered UIs
How to dynamically update CSS variables using JS
How to create torch/spotlight visual effects
How <video> elements behave with object-fit: cover
How SCSS nesting improves readability
How to combine UI effects with fluid mouse interactions
This task strengthened my understanding of dynamic visual effects, CSS variables, layering, and real-time UI interactions.

🌟 Acknowledgement
This Day 52 task helped me explore how modern web animations and light effects are built.
Thank you to Cohort 2.0 for providing creative and challenging projects that help me grow as a developer.
